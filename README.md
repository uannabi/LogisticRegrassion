# LogisticRegrassion
* Not all labels are continuous, sometimes you need to predict categories, this is known as classification.
* Logistic Regression is one of the basic ways to perform classification (don’t be confused by the word “regression”)
# Background 
* We want to learn about Logistic Regression as a method for Classification.
* Some examples of classification problems:
* Spam versus “Ham” emails
* Loan Default (yes/no)
* Disease Diagnosis
* Above were all examples of Binary Classification
* So far we’ve only seen regression problems where we try to predict a continuous value.
* Although the name may be confusing at first, logistic regression allows us to solve classification problems, where we are trying to predict discrete categories.
* The convention for binary classification is to have two classes 0 and 1.
